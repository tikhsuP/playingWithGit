# playingWithGit :smiley:

This repository has been created to serve as a playground for my git commands.

I have always wanted to play with git, make mistakes, use advanced git commands, mess things up and learn how to cover that mess, and have fun. Unfortunately, this isn't possible in any organization's repository. So, this is my playground. Feel free to have fun. 

#### Feel free to join me. Let's play together :stuck_out_tongue:
